    "Consider the excel data set provided by Alabama Power Company called Lambdas and RTP Customer Loads.

Lambda represents the incremental cost of generating one more unit (megawatt-hour) of electricity. In a typical year (non-leap year), there are 8760 hours; thus, this industry often refers to the “8760 lambdas.” As a general rule, generating units that run to help meet peak energy usage on the system are incrementally more expensive to run than baseload plants (those plants that run in both peak and off-peak times).
