    "\n",
    "* For studies involving humans:\n",
    "1. All planned studies must be reviewed in advance by an __Institutional Review Board__ (a panel of experts) charged with protecting the safety and well-being of humans involved. \n",
    "* Some studies require less rigorous review by an Institutional Review Board if they are considered to have only  \"minimal risk\" to the subjects of the study, which means the risks are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. All individuals in a study must give their __informed consent__ (know in advance the purpose of the study and any risks) before data are collected.\n",
    "* There are certain groups of people that have particular protections due to their limitations with informed consent and to avoid coercion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. All individual data must be kept __confidential__ (to protect an individual's privacy). Only statistical summaries for groups of people may be made public due to the possibly sensitive nature of data that is personally identifiable.  \n",
    "* Best practice is to separate the identity of the subjects from the rest of the data all at once. Confidentiality is not the same as anonymity (where the names are unknown - this is rare in statistical studies). \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, there are other ethical questions surrounding human subjects in a study such as gaining consent from those unable to give consent (e.g. unconscious in the emergency room) for research on a new medical treatment. \n",
